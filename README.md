Topic Description
----------------------------
   The game offers three types of visual challenges, making it the perfect game for multiple playing styles. Round one of this games all about speed as players race to manipulate their cubes to copy the pattern on the Q-bitz pattern card. In round two, players roll all of their cubes on the table like dice. Using the cubes as rolled (face up), players place as many cubes as possible in the tray to recreate the pattern shown on the card. Players race to re-roll all remaining unusable cubes until they roll the shapes that are needed to complete the pattern. Round three really tests brain power: players study the pattern card for ten seconds, flip it face down and then re-create the pattern from memory! 
   
Project Description
------------------------
  We plan to make a desktop application of this game with additional varying modes such as, 
    - Daily Challenge: Each day there will be a daily challenge assigned by developers, where each player are going to try to complete the challenge in the shortest time. Their completion times will be displayed in the leaderboard.
    - Switch Mode: 2 boards will be switched between two players, each player will interract with the board for a fixed time interval. The player who completes the puzzle wins. Players can disarrange the cubes on the board so players will use various strategies when playing this mode.
    - Survival mode: This is a single player mode in which player tries to solve as many puzzles as they can in a time interval. Player will start with a specified time, each time player solves a puzzle, he will be given additional time. So in this mode players will challenge themselves.
    - Game music.  
Differences between our project and the real game
------------------------------------------------------
  We will implement all the features of the real game to our project. However, our game will have additional modern features such as the game modes described above. We will offer the players a multiplayer smooth experience. Our game has singleplayer mode which is not available in the board game.
